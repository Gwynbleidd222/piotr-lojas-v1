This is my first personal trainer website, designed to showcase my services and allow potential clients to get in touch with me. The website includes a responsive navigation menu and a contact form written in PHP, which successfully handles form submissions. While the PHP file is not uploaded to GitHub, the frontend is fully functional, and the contact form works seamlessly when hosted on a server that supports PHP. The site is simple, user-friendly, and focused on providing essential information about my training services.
